// Middlware are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
// They can perform operations on the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack.
// Middleware can be used for logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and more.
// Middleswares can be added globally or to specific routes.
// Global middleware is applied to all routes, while route-specific middleware is applied only to specific routes.
// Before the handlers, middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined.
// All global middlewares that are defined before the route handlers will be executed for every request to the server.

// Built-in middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded data
