# Backend Lesson: JavaScript, Node.js, and Express

This lesson covers building a backend application using JavaScript, the Node.js runtime, and the Express framework.

*** All most everything will be available here.

ðŸŸ© Core Node.js

    fs, http â€” âœ… Good start with native modules; shows understanding of low-level.

ðŸŸ© Express Basics

    Express setup, basic routing, parameterized routing, req.query â€” âœ… Covers fundamentals.

    Middleware, custom middleware â€” âœ… Crucial for real-world apps.

    sendFile, res.render with EJS â€” âœ… Perfect for server-side rendering examples.

    Static file serving â€” âœ… Often missed; very useful.

ðŸŸ© Handling Forms & REST

    Form submissions â€” âœ… Good inclusion.

    REST API routes â€” âœ… Foundation of modern backend.

ðŸŸ© Database Integration

    MongoDB, PostgreSQL â€” âœ… Perfect â€” both NoSQL and relational DBs.

    Queries â€” âœ… Important (can show ORMs like Mongoose, Sequelize or raw SQL).

ðŸŸ© Security & Auth

    CORS â€” âœ… Covers frontend-backend integration.

    bcrypt, JWT, cookies, sessions â€” âœ… All essential for authentication.

    .env â€” âœ… Best practices.

ðŸŸ© Advanced Topics

    Error handling â€” âœ… Should show centralized error middleware.

    multer â€” âœ… File uploads: great!

    Nodemailer â€” âœ… Real-world application (e.g. email verification/reset).

ðŸŸ© Communication & Client Integration

    Axios/fetch for uptime server and client-server interaction â€” âœ… Practical, very relatable.

ðŸŸ© AI Integration

    Gemini Flash integration â€” âœ… Great modern touch, but:

        Make sure to show how it integrates with backend logic (e.g. prompts, APIs, security).

        Can also touch on OpenAI or HuggingFace as alternatives.

ðŸŸ© Core HTTP Concepts

    Status codes, headers â€” âœ… Excellent â€” foundational to all of web dev.
