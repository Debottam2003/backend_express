  <h1>Paneer Butter Masala</h1>
  <p>A rich and creamy Indian curry made with paneer (Indian cheese), tomatoes, butter, and a blend of aromatic spices.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <h3>For the Paneer:</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>200g paneer, cut into cubes</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>For the Gravy:</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
   <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
   <li>4 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
   <li>1/2 cup cashew nuts</li>
   <li>1/4 cup water</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), crushed</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional)</li>
   <li>Salt to taste</li>
   <li>1/2 cup fresh cream</li>
   <li>Fresh coriander leaves, for garnish</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <h3>Preparing the Paneer:</h3>
  <ol>
   <li>In a bowl, gently mix the paneer cubes with red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt.</li>
   <li>Heat oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat.</li>
   <li>Lightly sauté the paneer cubes until they are light golden brown on all sides. Be careful not to overcook them.</li>
   <li>Remove the paneer from the pan and set aside.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Making the Gravy:</h3>
  <ol>
   <li>In the same pan, add butter and let it melt over medium heat.</li>
   <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until they are golden brown.</li>
   <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
   <li>Add the roughly chopped tomatoes, cashew nuts, and water. Cover the pan and cook until the tomatoes are soft and mushy, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
   <li>Let the mixture cool down completely.</li>
   <li>Once cooled, blend the tomato-cashew mixture into a smooth puree using a blender.</li>
   <li>Strain the puree through a fine-mesh sieve to get a smooth gravy.</li>
   <li>Return the strained gravy to the same pan. Add red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
   <li>Add the sautéed paneer cubes and crushed kasuri methi to the gravy. Gently mix and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the paneer to absorb the flavors.</li>
   <li>Stir in sugar (if using) and fresh cream. Cook for a minute.</li>
   <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
   <li>Serve hot with naan, roti, or rice.</li>
  </ol>
